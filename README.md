# Logistic-regression-use-cases-Algerian-Forest-Fires-Dataset
## Data Set Information:
The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.

122 instances for each region.

The period from June 2012 to September 2012. The dataset includes 11 attribues and 1 output attribue (class) The 244 instances have been classified into â€˜fireâ€™ (138 classes) and â€˜not fireâ€™ (106 classes) classes.

## Project Details:
Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering of the datasets
Using Logistic regression Model for Binary classification to Predict the Fire and Non Fire cases of the forest
